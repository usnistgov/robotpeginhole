\section*{INTRODUCTION}

This article illustrates preparation of ASME paper using \LaTeX2\raisebox{-.3ex}{$\epsilon$}. The \LaTeX\  macro \verb+asme2e.cls+, the {\sc Bib}\TeX\ style file \verb+asmems4.bst+, and the template \verb+asme2e.tex+ that create this article are available on the WWW  at the URL address \verb+http://iel.ucdavis.edu/code/+. To ensure compliance with the 2003 ASME MS4 style guidelines  \cite{asmemanual}, you should modify neither the \LaTeX\ macro \verb+asme2e.cls+ nor the {\sc Bib}\TeX\ style file \verb+asmems4.bst+. By comparing the output generated by typesetting this file and the \LaTeX2\raisebox{-.3ex}{$\epsilon$} source file, you should find everything you need to help you through the preparation of ASME paper using \LaTeX2\raisebox{-.3ex}{$\epsilon$}. Details on using \LaTeX\ can be found in \cite{latex}. Instructions for submitting an electronic version of a paper via ftp for publication on CD-ROM or online  are given at the URL address \verb+http://www.asme.org/pubs/submittal.html+.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY LONG HEADING}

If the heading should run into more than one line, the run-over is flush left.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Second-Level Heading}

The next level of heading is boldface with upper and lower case letters. The heading is flushed left with the left margin. The spacing to the next heading is two line spaces.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Third-Level Heading.}

The third-level of heading follows the style of the second-level heading, but it is indented and followed by a period, a space, and the start of corresponding text.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{PAPER NUMBER}

ASME assigns each accepted paper with a unique number. Replace {\bf DETC98/DAC-1234} in the input file preamble (the location will be obvious) with the paper number supplied to you  by ASME for your paper.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{USE OF SI UNITS}

An ASME paper should use SI units.  When preference is given to SI units, the U.S. customary units may be given in parentheses or omitted. When U.S. customary units are given preference, the SI equivalent {\em shall} be provided in parentheses or in a supplementary table. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{MATHEMATICS}

Equations should be numbered consecutively beginning with (1) to the end of the paper, including any appendices.  The number should be enclosed in parentheses and set flush right in the column on the same line as the equation.  An extra line of space should be left above and below a displayed equation or formula. \LaTeX\ can automatically keep track of equation numbers in the paper and format almost any equation imaginable. An example is shown in Eqn.~(\ref{eq_ASME}). The number of a referenced equation in the text should be preceded by Eqn.\ unless the reference starts a sentence in which case Eqn.\ should be expanded to Equation.

\begin{equation}
f(t) = \int_{0_+}^t F(t) dt + \frac{d g(t)}{d t}
\label{eq_ASME}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{FIGURES AND TABLES}

All figures should be positioned at the top of the page where possible.  All figures should be numbered consecutively and captioned; the caption uses all capital letters, and centered under the figure as shown in Fig.~\ref{figure_ASME}. All text within the figure should be no smaller than 7~pt. There should be a minimum two line spaces between figures and text. The number of a referenced figure or table in the text should be preceded by Fig.\ or Tab.\ respectively unless the reference starts a sentence in which case Fig.\ or Tab.\ should be expanded to Figure or Table.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin figure %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}

\begin{picture}(115,35)(255,545)

\put(275,560){Beautiful Figure}
\end{picture}
\end{center}
\caption{THE FIGURE CAPTION USES CAPITAL LETTERS.}
\label{figure_ASME} 
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end figure %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin table   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{table}[t]
\caption{THE TABLE CAPTION USES CAPITAL LETTERS, TOO.}
\begin{center}
\label{table_ASME}
\begin{tabular}{c l l}

Example & Time & Cost \\
\hline

2 & 24 & \$2,000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end table %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All tables should be numbered consecutively and  captioned; the caption should use all capital letters, and centered above the table as shown in Table~\ref{table_ASME}. The body of the table should be no smaller than 7 pt.  There should be a minimum two line spaces between tables and text.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{FOOTNOTES\protect\footnotemark}
\footnotetext{Examine the input file, asme2e.tex, to see how a footnote is given in a head.}

Footnotes are referenced with superscript numerals and are numbered consecutively from 1 to the end of the paper\footnote{Avoid footnotes if at all possible.}. Footnotes should appear at the bottom of the column in which they are referenced.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{CITING REFERENCES}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The ASME reference format is defined in the authors kit provided by the ASME.  The format is:

\begin{quotation}
{\em Text Citation}. Within the text, references should be cited in  numerical order according to their order of appearance.  The numbered reference citation should be enclosed in brackets.
\end{quotation}

The references must appear in the paper in the order that they were cited.  In addition, multiple citations (3 or more in the same brackets) must appear as a `` [1-3]''.  A complete definition of the ASME reference format can be found in the  ASME manual \cite{asmemanual}.

The bibliography style required by the ASME is unsorted with entries appearing in the order in which the citations appear. If that were the only specification, the standard {\sc Bib}\TeX\ unsrt bibliography style could be used. Unfortunately, the bibliography style required by the ASME has additional requirements (last name followed by first name, periodical volume in boldface, periodical number inside parentheses, etc.) that are not part of the unsrt style. Therefore, to get ASME bibliography formatting, you must use the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file with {\sc Bib}\TeX. This file is not part of the standard BibTeX distribution so you'll need to place the file someplace where LaTeX can find it (one possibility is in the same location as the file being typeset).

With \LaTeX/{\sc Bib}\TeX, \LaTeX\ uses the citation format set by the class file and writes the citation information into the .aux file associated with the \LaTeX\ source. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ reads the .aux file and matches the citations to the entries in the bibliographic data base file specified in the \LaTeX\ source file by the \verb+\bibliography+ command. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ then writes the bibliography in accordance with the rules in the bibliography .bst style file to a .bbl file which \LaTeX\ merges with the source text.  A good description of the use of {\sc Bib}\TeX\ can be found in \cite{latex, goosens} (see how 2 references are handled?).  The following is an example of how three or more references \cite{latex, asmemanual,  goosens} show up using the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file in conjunction with the \verb+asme2e.cls+ class file. Here are some more \cite{art, blt, ibk, icn, ips, mts, mis, pro, pts, trt, upd} which can be used to describe almost any sort of reference.

% Here's where you specify the bibliography style file.
% The full file name for the bibliography style file 
% used for an ASME paper is asmems4.bst.
\bibliographystyle{asmems4}
